Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 21

## Contents

- **AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb**: My solution to Steps 1-2 of the challenge, with basic cleanup and a naive model.
- **AlphabetSoupCharity.h5**: Model created by the above
- **AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb**: My solution to Step 3 of the challenge, adjusting the data and model creation to try to improve accuracy.
- **AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5**: Model created by the above "optimized" notebook
- **AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.keras**: More modern format of model created by the above "optimized" notebook
- **report.md**: My solution to Step 4 of the Challenge, the written report
- **images/\***: Images referred to by the report
- **Starter_Code.ipynb**: Code provided for the challenge, preserved for reference

## Instructions

With either a Google Colab connection, or a standard environment from class (including TensorFlow), load AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb and run all cells. This will fetch and clean the data, then create a new model. Note the 3rd block has several flags and parameters you can adjust. Creating a good model is still a rather interactive experience.
